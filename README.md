## 📋 Task Description

As part of the assignment:

1. A model was trained using [Teachable Machine] with two classes:
   - Formula 1 Car 🏁
   - Regular Car 🚗
2. The model was exported in **TensorFlow → Keras (.h5)** format.
3. A **Google Colab notebook** was used to:
   - Load the model (`keras_model.h5`)
   - Accept an input image
   - Predict the image class
4. This repository contains:
   - The trained model files
   - The Colab notebook
   - An output screenshot
   - This README file
